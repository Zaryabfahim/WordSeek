## How to Play
1. **Start a game**: Use the `/new` command in a group or private chat.

   - ðŸŸ© - Correct letter in the right spot.
   - ðŸŸ¨ - Correct letter in the wrong spot.
   - ðŸŸ¥ - Letter not in the word.
4. The game ends when:
   - The word is correctly guessed, or
   - Maximum number of guesses (30) is reached.
5. The first person to guess the word correctly wins!
